1,AVOID Porche/VW at ALL COSTS!!!!,"If there is one business that you need to AVOID AVOID on this planet, it would be Porsche (or mother company VW in General)!!!!! Disrespect, arrogance and extremely bad quality in recent years!!!!!!!!!",1
2,Non existant customer service.,"Porsche UK need a root and branch review of their terrible customer service centre. From top to bottom they have poor response time, ignore emails, ignore specific requests/actions & haven't got a clue about UK consumer legislation.

First and last Porsche car I will ever buy and I try to put people off buying into a formerly prestige brand.",1
3,Void Porsche I bought my Maccan S in…,"Void Porsche I bought my Maccan S in September I had such nightmares with Porsche company regarding monthly payment , they charged me twice in December and tried to take another payment today 10 th January since September I can say easily be on the phone every month for several hours and still they looking to it to find what is wrong I’m so fed up 3 months in my agreement I want change my car",1
4,Porsche customer service (uk) =…,"Porsche customer service (uk) = mentally inept on the end of the phone line
They have their heads so far up their rectum them they think they are providing service when all they do is think they are better than other car manufactures , if you want to by a Porsche by BMW",1
5,Avoid buying a Porsche,"Avoid buying a Porsche. We just received a Taycan 4S. Having waited 11 months fir the car it so far has been rubbish. The app doesn’t work, the central PCM display switches itself off and the customer service is zero. Earliest we can book it in is 6 weeks away, with no loan car. Porsche take your money and then wash their hands if you.",1
6,Stay away from buying from Porsche,"Stay away from buying from Porsche, especially the Taycan. We bought a brand new Taycan this year, had it for 2 months and it's riddled with safety issues. The dealer we bought it from threw their hands up and gave up on the repairs and now Porsche North America is telling us they can't do anything, we are stuck with a lemon. 35 recalls alone this year, it's sad and disgraceful that this brand has suffered so badly. DO NOT BUY from them, their prices have gone up and quality has come down and their service centers are so overloaded, they have no loaners are taking weeks to even start your repairs. Worst customer experience ever. Just do yourself a favor and stay away!!!",
7,I love the new 911,I love the new 911! Have been a Porsche fan for many years. And personally own 2 911’s. True masterpieces of machines.,5
8,poor service Porsche Glasgow,"Had my Porsche 911 in for repairs and mot and was kept in for over 2 months, upon receiving and after 3 weeks the low oil light came on.
I spoke with Porsche Glasgow centre and although they did the mot and service they did not check the oil.
My bill was just short of £6000, I was somewhat upset and emailed the Glasgow manager Iain Esdale , been a week now and no response whatsoever.",1
9,I’ve owned a Taycan for 15 months,"I’ve owned a Taycan for 15 months. Between checks, recalls and serious problems it has been back to Porsche 5 times, most of which I’ve had to deliver myself because they do not have adequate facilities to collect. They are producing cars with more problems than they can resolve. Each time has been a long wait without a replacement. As I write the charging ports will not open. Porsche Assist can not fix. Dealer can not collect or confirm any booking in. Unacceptable for what should be a premium product.",1
10,Porsche has literally hit rock bottom.,"Porsche has literally hit rock bottom.

They have manufactured more cars than they have chips for, and then are fobbing them off on customers with recalls and promises to make good on the chips, but rather than doing so, they continue to produce more new models - many with the ""missing chips"" and do not honor their promised recalls.

This is deplorable and possibly illegal. If others have experienced the same, please join me in a class action suit unless Porsche changes their actions.",1
11,I love this product,"I love this product. it is functional and aesthetically pleasing. if you are looking for a product to make your life easier, i highly recommend this product.",4
12,Porsche Reading unsatisfactory customer service,"At least three interactions with Porsche Reading in recent weeks. None of them satisfactory - particularly for a high end car dealership. Recently bought a 991 with an extended Porsche warranty which need a couple of straightforward things doing to it. The hurdles presented by Porsche Reading and timelines involved resulted in me getting the first, very minor but potentially important issue, repaired at the local independent Porsche garage, within days, but at my own cost and the second, with 30mins on hold before getting through and being cut-off twice, involving an amber warning light which is preventing use, had a date of August proposed for repair unless I took out ""Porsche Assist"" and got the vehicle picked up and taken to Porsche Reading. Again, now booked in with the local independent specialist. So much for extended warranties and great Porsche Service!",1
13,Porsche Financial service (pfs )…,Porsche Financial service (pfs ) selling your info to every company in the us . This cheaters and arrogant company’s like bmw . Mercedes Benz financial selling the info even they cheated you on interest or contract!! Don’t fake loan or any Bussiness with them !!,1
14,Your Porsche Macan isn't waterproof!!!,"Apparently a Porsche Macan is not waterproof, and it is necessary to perform periodic checks on the car to check to see if the roof rails have not blocked up leading to serious flooding of the cars floor/rear. I am facing a hefty bill to rectify a problem that is a manufacturing fault, which Porsche simply won't acknowledge. Utter disgrace of a company.",
15,Love my car :),,4
16,Amazing experience,"Amazing experience, even when buying from home due to covid! James Eadington in particular was a fantastic salesman. Many happy miles with the 718 cayman GTS!",5
17,The best sports cars,"Want to look good, and impress those around you with a car that's not only fast, but good looking? Look no further than porsche.",5
18,I will never buy a Porsche again,"I ordered my first ever Porsche in 2018, Panamera Sport Turismo and it went downhill from the second I placed the deposit. 12 months of excuses and no communication from Porsche, just me chasing and I then find they were delivering their own demonstrators to dealers ahead of customers who had been waiting for over a year. Sales guys are super arrogant and have a simple attitude of 'it's a Porsche, do you want it or not?'. Aftercare is non existent. Lots of small poor quality issues. Electric spoiler kept sticking, interior trim unclipping the fixing on the driver floor mat snapped off after 3 months and yep, they wanted to charge me to fix it. The letter 'E' on the rear Porsche sign lifted and snapped off after 6 months, yup, £200 and they made me buy all the letters, wouldn't sell just the E even though they are individual letters. Went in for the service, they kept it a day longer than agreed and still failed to fix the issues such as the stuck spoiler, broken mat or missing letter. They didn't even manage to wash the car when they were done. I switched through 3 dealers and was treated with contempt by each one. When you pay 6 figures for a car and as a brand new customer to the brand you would maybe think they would at least do what you paid them for. I just got rid of the car after only 15 months. Owning a Porsche has been one of the most unhappy car experiences of my life. Never again and I would strongly recommend you think long and hard before subjecting yourself to their contempt.",1
19,Porsche Taycan Turbo S Suddenly Broke Down While Driving,"Horrible unreliability from Porsche today on January 29, 2021. Our Porsche Taycan Turbo S broke down at nighttime, and my parents had to walk home. I will not ever recommend any Taycan model in the Taycan lineup.",1
20,"We regret buying a Porsche, spend your money on a better brand",We do NOT recommend Porsche. Bought a new vehicle and the car has had nothing but problems. The dealership's service department is incompetent. But Porsche North America doesn't stand behind their vehicles and they have no control over their dealerships. Worst mistake we ever made was to buy a Porsche.,1
21,The G.O.A.T of cars!,"Porsche really shows why it's the best brand around: Amazing cars that will draw the eye of any onlooker, at great prices, and a very very solid post-sale support team. Truly superb!",5
22,Love these cars <3,,5

Thank you so much for always delivering.",5

25,I have leased 2018 Porsche cayenne,"I have leased 2018 Porsche cayenne, and since then I'm so frustrated from the Porsche customer-service level and attitude. I'm 63 years old and has drive Mercedes, BMW, Audi ... and based on my experience Porsche is the WORST customer-service ever, customer doesn't have the best service and good feeling as expected from luxury car. I made my own decision that this Porsche defiantly will be my LAST PORSCHE ever.",1
