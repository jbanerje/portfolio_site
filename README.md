## Projects
**Ryanair Passenger Reviews Analysis**

In the rapidly growing aviation industry, analyzing customer feedback is critical for improving service quality and customer experience. This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Ryanair passenger reviews from 2012 to 2024. By employing sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and root cause analysis, the study identifies key areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, highlights operational challenges, and pinpoints routes with recurring issues. A custom machine learning-based sentiment classifier is developed to automate sentiment categorization, and innovative graph network visualizations are used to trace negative sentiments back to specific routes. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights to enhance Ryanair’s operational and customer service strategies.

**Amazon Product Bundling and Recommendation**

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales data to gain valuable insights into sales trends, customer purchase behavior, and other factors influencing profitability. Leveraging various data mining techniques such as exploratory data analysis, clustering, association mining, and predictive modeling, we aim to extract meaningful patterns and relationships to build a product bundling strategy and recommend focused products to customers. By delving into multifaceted dimensions such as product categories, geographical distributions, and sales performance metrics, this analysis will furnish actionable insights to refine sales strategies and augment overall profitability.

## Case Study
**Optimizing cancer patient care with advanced analytics**
The Oscar Lambret Center, a premier cancer treatment and research institution in Lille, France,
embarked on a research initiative to establish personalized care pathways for cancer patients. These
pathways are designed to guide physicians in delivering tailored and consistent care for improved
patient outcomes. The project aligns with the center’s mission of providing high-quality care and
fostering multidisciplinary collaboration. By leveraging advanced analytics, the center aimed to
consolidate siloed data and create dynamic, actionable insights to enhance care quality and operational
efficiency. Hospital faced challenges in delivering personalized care pathways for cancer
patients wanted to improve patient outcomes by establishing benchmarks for standard treatment
times to prevent care delays and Optimizing workforce allocation and resource utilization for multidisciplinary
cancer care.
