https://www.edmunds.com/,"Have less than 4k miles and the thing is falling apart. Constant problems. Worse yet, Porsche has basically said - It's your problem but that you for letting us know our car is junk. "
https://www.edmunds.com/,"Was looking at the new c8, but the lack of sports car feel and handling made me go out and test drive a 911. After the test drive I was sold. 1200 miles in and it?s been a love affair with the road that I haven?t had since owning my 2001 YZF-R6."
https://www.edmunds.com/,"Traded in a Corvette for the new 2020 Porsche Carrera S. In short, I have never looked backed. The performance and handling are true German outstanding engineering. It feels similar in straight line speed but handling is tighter with the Porsche. The car just feels better built to me and renewed my excitement about driving a sports car. The interior is very comfortable and instrument panel fantastic. My only con is that the learning curve is more for feeling comfortable with all the controls. After a few weeks, the controls came natural to me. I have been surprised by all the capabilities of the controls. The one surprise was that I did not have AM on the radio. However, I was able to get it via bluetooth from my phone. "
https://www.edmunds.com/,"This car is insane. I've owned 6 Porsche cars even a 911 Turbo. This new 992 S is insane from the new body lines to the interior, Porsche got this one right."
https://www.edmunds.com/,"I?ve had a 997 Carrera S and 991 GTS and this is by far the better machine . Very quick, very comfortable ( drop the tire pressures to Porsche comfort levels ) much more of a GT car when it needs to be. My first 911 convertible and what a joy, very comfortable with top down even at highway speeds with wind blocker. Everything is just so dialed in , the PDK, the different driver modes and the quality has a jewel like quality. It?s still a event every time I drive it. "
https://www.edmunds.com/,"911 C2 Carrera S is everything and more than I could have wanted, The car is so enjoyable to drive that I often find myself smiling or laughing at how incredible and usable the performance is. It makes you feel like a better driver than you are. All specifications are on line so I won't mention them however I will discuss how those number translate in the real world. O-60 and 60-0 are easily achieved without drama. The brakes are so strong that I find myself occasionally looking in the rear view mirror hoping the car behind me left enough braking room. 4 wheel steering is a must purchase option. Lane changes at highway speeds and above are telepathic, no body lean, no upset to the chassis, just rock solid performance. Interior is pleasant but not luxurious considering the price. Sound levels are rather high at around town speeds but fade away on the highway. Storage is adequate thanks to the small back seat which can never be used for a human over 4 ft tall. I have noticed when the temp drops below 45 degrees the tires have a hard time keeping contact during rapid acceleration from stand still. This is typical of summer tires however makes me think maybe I should have opted for the 4S. Update...Car now has 4K miles . Still agree with my original review. Had the car on the track finally and it was superb. Few stock vehicles can keep up with it. Steering feedback is excellent, you can feel when your approaching the limits of adhesion. Brakes are powerful. I could late brake into a turn well after other vehicles were on their binders. Rained in the afternoon which gave me the opportunity to test wet mode on the track. Once again the car amazes. All but 2 cars pitted during the storm but my Porsche felt planted. You can't imagine the performance capability of this vehicle until you bring it to the track. 8K update...All the above still apply. Car has experiences many service bulletins and engine mounts needed to be replaced on a recall. Not surprised as this was a very early build. Now for some negatives 1) Why no AM radio band? Ludicrous on a car of this cost they couldn't include AM radio, 2) Programming the garage door opener is a nightmare. Why cant they follow the other divisions (Volkswagen,Audi) software which is easily programed. 3) Customer support from Porsche USA online or via telephone is pathetic, as is their vehicles owners manual. Phone customer service representatives just repeat whats in the owners manual which is weak at best."
https://www.edmunds.com/,"This is a solid, very fast, sporty head turner. Worth the sacrifice. "
https://www.edmunds.com/,I bought this car used with 400 miles the fit and finish is of course impeccable. There is a significant amount road noise that enters through the thin convertible top at the rear quarters. The performance and handling are exquisite. Punch the accelerator and expect to get thrown back in your seat as the car quickly approaches breathtaking speeds. Porsche changed over to an electronic shifter which disappoints as it amounts to what is best termed a ?tickle button?. Still the instrumentation has been uncluttered by wonderful technology proving better ease of operation. If you?re in the market for a invertirle performance roadster look no further.
https://www.edmunds.com/,"Owned every Porsche model offered in 2018-2019, except for the Cayenne. This 992 911 S is far superior to others, including two or three GTS variants. Steering, handling and acceleration are perfect. Not good - really, perfect. It would be hard to imagine a better balance between insane capability and every day comfort. "
https://www.edmunds.com/,"The 2020 911 Carrera S is an outstanding high performance quality grand touring car. Edgy enough for track days or long distance driving trips. With the current bad weather we haven?t got the 911 out much at all. But it is a beauty to behold, even in the garage!!!!"
https://www.edmunds.com/,"I had the new mid-engine corvette convertible on order but due to supplier issue, kept on getting pushed backed. GM did say they will produce 2020 vettes into December if needed, however had little to no communication with their customers concerning build dates. Not wanting to pay full price for a car that's basically one year old, I decided to go for the gusto and spring for a new Porsche 911 Cabriolet. The car is fun to drive and has excellent build quality. The only problem I have had so far is I cannot get the Homelink to open the gate to my community and was told to take it to my local Porsche dealership for help, and the MMI system could be much more user friendly. This is nothing compared tothe vette which has had transmissions with debris, fit and finish problems and computer problems to name a few. In the long run, the decision to get the 911 was the right one for me. "
https://www.edmunds.com/,Comfortable to sit in. Fabulous steering and acceleration. Every minute a joy!
https://www.edmunds.com/,"Such a blast. I never quite understood why people bought these. Now I know. There is driving and there is Porsche Driving. I regularly drive past my house just for fun, after grocery shopping for instance. There has been a lot of melted ice cream in my house since I got the car. The car can be a track car and a daily driver. Surprisingly I get a lot of stuff crammed into the small non trunk. The only slight so so items are the seats can hurt. Maybe it is me? Also the Bose stereo stinks for what it costs."
https://www.bbb.org/,"Purchased brand new Taycan in 2020. One of the car options was a $14XX upgraded charger. The charger has a design defect which is documented online in forums and articles. I have been to the dealership 4 times and probably have 25 hours invested in talking to multiple dealerships, porsche NA, customer service. I had to purchase another aftermarket charger which works perfectly. The porsche charger is sitting in my garage collecting dust."
https://www.bbb.org/,"I had my car 2016 Porsche Cayenne GTS VIN: ***************** serviced in July 2020 when it was still under CPO warranty. I was told there was oil leak from engine which it's a manufacture defect . By that time, it was not that bad. I didn't have to refill the oil quite often and couldn't see any oil spot on my parking lot. I put my car in the waiting list to be resealed. Finally i got it done in September. But after the fix, things became much worse. Not only could i see leaked oil spot on my parking lot, but also leak oil on from my engine which i've never seen before. The full engine oil can only sustain 3-4 months so that i have to do the refill because of the warning indicator of low oil level on dashboard. Now the car is just out of warranty. The last repair didn't fix the issue but made it even worse. I contacted Porsche customer service and requested the dealer survey again. They promised to send to me in 2-3 business day. But I still haven't received it yet after 2 weeks."
https://www.bbb.org/,"My Cayenne broke down in Florida and I took it to Orlando Porsche. I custom order the car in 2006, only put 60K miles on it, always had it Porsche serviced. No accidents garage kept everything original has she was my baby. I was told by the dealer that the transfer case was faulty and quoted about $7000 for the repair, unfortunately only slightly under the KBB value of the vehicle, which prompted me to sell it at book value to my son in law. I was recently informed that the dealers diagnosis was incorrect and i prematurely sold my prized Porsche due to an error on behalf of the dealer service department. I have always thought highly of Porsche and their service department, that is why I also own a Macan. Now due to the loss of my car we are left with only one vehicle and after these recent events and the unprofessional manner in which they were dealt with I doubt I will ever consider to be part of the Porsche family ever again. I will let everyone know about my terrible experience."
https://www.bbb.org/,"My father in law's Cayenne broke down in Orlando and he was told that the transfer case was faulty. To replace it, he was quoted about $7000 dollar, he refused to spend that money although the car was still in perfect condition so he sold it to me. I had the car shipped to NY and took it to my mechanic to replace the transfer case. The car came off the lift with the exact same symptoms so I took it to Town Porsche in Englewood NJ. I was told that the transfer case was faulty, again, and the TC motor was not installed correctly. I went off and bought another transfer case and when it came time to install it the head mechanic felt that it could have been something else so instead of replacing it for the second time he actually diagnosed the problem and It turned out to be the wheel sensor and the wheel bearing. The problem all along was a trivial wheel sensor. I spent thousands of dollars because of the poor job done by two separate Porsche dealers, which I find blatantly unprofessional."
https://www.bbb.org/,"In July 2020 I purchased a 2018 Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) Panamera 4 from Porsche Jackson MS dealership. I am located in Plantation (Ft Laud), Fl. During the facetime showing of the vehicle, the salesrep pointed out all features & benefits of the car. I was only interested in a CPO to purchase due to proof of all work, authorized repairs, inspections, brakes, tires, and transfer of current warranty & extended warranty. During this facetime showing I was advised the vehicle is CPO, the brakes are great, and the tires are ""all seasonal"". I paid out of pocket to have the vehicle delivered to our home here in South Florida in a closed truck. I began to have rotational tire sounds inconsistent with a high-performance vehicle so I phoned the dealer I purchased from, and they recommended I contact a local dealer in South Florida. The local dealer immediately noticed at least 1 major issue which is I have ""winter-snow tires"". I have contacted the original dealer & they refuse to assist."
https://www.bbb.org/,"New 2019 Cayenne with tailgate rattle, 4 times / 45 days in service. Declined buyback. No remedy offered. I ordered a new 2019 Cayenne e-hybrid, and took delivery in August, 2019. It had a tailgate squeak, or rattle that was unnerving. I took the car to 2 different dealerships, a total of 4 services. The car was in the shop 45 days during my first 6 months of ownership. I applied for a repurchase two times, the second sent via Fed-X and included photographs. ""Respectfully denied"" both times. Four times / 45 days in service for the same issue in 6 months- I traded it in and suffered a substantial drop in value."
Google Review,"I purchased a brand new 2020 Porsche Macan S (from another dealer) and there was a defect with a dead bug inside the instrument cluster (see photo).  I decided to have it addressed at the first service/oil change at Porsche Exchange due to my current location.  Service reps immediately asked for $5000 saying it isn?t covered.  The original selling dealer said it is covered under warranty.  Now it?s a Porsche internal politics game with the customer suffering and I have involved headquarters in US and Germany on this.  I know it will be made right in the end but unsure of the games being played for what?s supposed to be a premium vehicle.

A second issue was a brake fault light displayed (see photo).  I took it in for service and was provided their entry Macan as a loaner.  To me this is bad service and a missed opportunity to push other vehicles in their brand.  I did enquire about it and they mentioned availability.  Granted when I arrived, the whole dealership was empty so I am skeptical to the validity of this and even though I had to book the appointment a week out, it seems they forgot about the loaner when I arrived.  To boot the Macan loaner had less than 100 miles on it and squeaky brakes which was annoying to drive in rush hour traffic for hours.

Now when I picked up my car it looked brand new.  They did do magic here and the car works well.  But the constant asking me via text how my experience was when I have an outstanding issue with them was bothersome.  I responded mentioning the issue and no manager was available to contact me until Monday (now is Thursday morning), probably to say the same again.  Regards to the brake problem, I was told a software issue (weird?) that has been updated.  Update: A full week later and no one from Porsche Exchange contacted me and my emails have been ignored."
